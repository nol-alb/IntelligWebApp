                <h1>Welcome To The Study</h1>
                <p class="lead">This is a rhythm recreation study and performance assessment tool developed by Noel Alben to
                  aid in his research.
                  We are looking for participants in an online experiment we are conducting concerning rhythm pedagogy. The study is conducted online and consists 
                  of only one half-hour session using this website. You will interact with this app, which teaches you how to clap common rhythmic patterns. Weâ€™d love it if you would be willing to help us out! 
                  There will be a compensation of $15 upon completion of this study, you will be required to provide us your name and mailing address so we can send you a cheque.
		  Necessary directions will be provided in a questionnaire at the end of the study.

                  Only adults (18 years or older) may participate. If you are interested in participating, please contact Noel Alben at noelalben@gatech.edu.
