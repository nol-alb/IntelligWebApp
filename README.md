# Web Application used in the thesis: RHYTHM RECREATION STUDY TO INFORM INTELLIGENT RHYTHM PEDAGOGY SYSTEMS

Computer-based intelligent pedagogy systems have great potential to provide interactive
music lessons to those unable to access conventional, face-to-face music instruction
from human experts. A key component of any effective pedagogy system is the expert domain
knowledge used to generate, present, and evaluate the teachable content that makes
up the “syllabus” of the system. In this thesis, we investigate the application of computational
musicology algorithms to devise the “syllabus” of intelligent rhythm pedagogy
software through a rhythm recreation study. **This repository** is dedicated to the development
of a web-based computer-aided rhythm tutor used as an experimental interface
to conduct the rhythm recreation study. The resulting system can present targeted rhythm
exercises to the participants and provide immediate feedback on the participant’s rhythm
performance audio.
